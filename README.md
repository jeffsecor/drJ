# Chlorophyll, Quantum Dots, Lasers, Greenhouses...


In another life, I research the interaction of light with different forms of matter.  In simple terms, that means I shoot lasers at things to understand their properties.  For example, if you shine a blue laser at a spinach leaf, it will glow red.  That red glow tells us quite a bit about the photosynthetic process. In particular, I am most interested in combining a new type of nano particle, a carbon quantum dot, with natually ocurring photo-active dyes in hopes to develop the knowledge to make next generation alternative energy sources.  Here is a link to my publcations on  [*googlescholar*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-RageY8AAAAJ&hl=en). 

In another parallel life, I built up a landscape concstruction design and build business in Brooklyn, and you can see some of that work on my [instagram](instagram.com/jsgardens). Over time I developed a love and skill for urban agriculture, project execution, moderate construction project management skills, and the ability to "get it done" 


But I suppose you wonder why I'm here, and why I'm programming.  Here's an unordered list of reasons why:

what is the chirp before a price jump and is it different from chirp befor a drop 
what is the optimal holding time of a stock. Daily, weekly, monthly etc for number of days prior or within a window
plot "center of mass" versus time and analyze at tipping points

# The amount of power programming can wield is outrageous

In another life, I do some [physics](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-RageY8AAAAJ&hl=en).  In a parallel life, I'm a landscape concstruction design and build guy in Brooklyn, and you can see some of that work on my [instagram](instagram.com/jsgardens).  But I suppose you wonder why I'm here, and why I'm programming.  Here's an unordered list of reasons why:

*it's in my nature to ask hard questions, and computers have more RAM than people
*love for math and logic
*persistent desire to create something
*chance of never ending challenges
*job with money
*opportunity to make really cool graphics from complicated data sets

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffsecor/drJ/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

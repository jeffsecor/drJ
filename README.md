# Chlorophyll, Quantum Dots, Lasers, Greenhouses...


In another life, I research the interaction of light with different forms of matter.  In simple terms, that means I shoot lasers at things to understand their properties.  For example, if you shine a blue laser at a spinach leaf, it will glow red.  That red glow tells us quite a bit about the photosynthetic process. In particular, I am most interested in combining a new type of nano particle, a carbon quantum dot, with natually ocurring photo-active dyes in hopes to develop the knowledge to make next generation alternative energy sources.  Here is a link to my publcations on  [*googlescholar*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-RageY8AAAAJ&hl=en). 

In another parallel life, I built up a landscape concstruction design and build business in Brooklyn, and you can see some of that work on my [instagram](https://instagram.com/jsgardens). Over time I developed a love and skill for urban agriculture, project execution, moderate construction project management skills, and the ability to "get it done" 


But I suppose you wonder why I'm here, and why I'm programming.  Here's an unordered list of reasons why:

* Im too productive for academia.  One of my favorite things others have said about me is that Im good at shaking things up, moving forward, and getting things done.  This is not often welcomed in an academic enviromnent.  
* My projects have grown beyond what I can do myself.  As a lanscape design and build business, I reached a legal and technical limit to the scope of projects I can take on.  My natural tendency is to grow and take on bigger questions. Ive seen that computers and programming offer the greatest power to take on the challenges that interest me.  
* I love to create. Anything that could be tangible or intangible, numerical or visual, finite or infinite.  Programming can quickly enable this.
* Can I write a program to visuallize the eveolution of human civilization trade routes and cities and compare it to cancer? (Im not so nihilistic, but do think its an interesting comparison)
* How does the closing times of international stock markets affect the New York markets?
* to answer what is the trading volume and price chirp before a jump and is it different from chirp befor a drop? 
* To plot "center of mass" of a stock versus time and analyze at tipping points
* In all honesty, to get a job in data science
